CHANGES THAT COULD BREAK YOUR OLD CODE
======================================

===============================
For code based on version < 2.0
===============================

Starting with version 2.0, a few critical changes (that could break your old
code based on versions < 2.0) have been introduced. You can maintain your old
code whether adapting it to the new style (very easy job to do), or using the
old 1.31 version.

Object creation
    - The new method accept a unique optional HASH reference containing the
      following optional constructor arrays: -markers, -lookups, -behaviours

Locations
    - locations are now passed as an ARRAY reference under the constructor array
      "-lookups" (see new())

Syntax
    - Syntax is an object property now, (before, it was a class property)
    - syntax() method desn't exist any more
    - Custom syntax is now passed as an ARRAY reference under the constructor
      array "-markers" or as a markers extension name
    - see default_markers() private method to do the same inside a subclass, and
      new() method

Subs execution
    - Subs_execution method desn't exist any more, nor the old deprecated
      methods that were doing the same
    - to avoid subs execution, just explicitly omit the 'CODE' behaviour when
      create a new object:
      $mt=new Text::MagicTemplate{-behaviours=>[qw(SCALAR REF ARRAY HASH)]}

Static get_block() and set_block() are now object methods


================================
For code based on version < 2.05
================================

Another very little change has been introduced in version 2.1 too. This could 
affect your code based on 2.05 ONLY if you was using your own custom behaviours 
OR lookups in subroutines.

The new Text::MagicTemplate::Zone object has been introduced. Now all your subs 
triggered by a lookup and all the behaviours receive as a parameter a single ref
to the object.
You can access all the old parameters related to the zone by using the object 
methods:

      $z->id
      $z->content
      $z->attributes
      $z->value
      $z->lookup_element
